This application is built using the Java programming language. Running an application such as this is not very straightforward due to Java’s lack of support of creating a simple .exe file. As far as we know, the project only works on the Mac operating system. In this case, Java’s executable file is called a .jar file. There are two files you need to install in order to run this program on your computer: GradeMaster.jar GradeMaster.sh

The first thing that a user needs to download is JavaFX, which is an open-source GUI application library. After downloading the .zip file, unzip to a destination you can easily remember.

Now, the .sh file must be manipulated to function on your device. The .sh file contains an argument that will utilize the JavaFX library we downloaded earlier. Right-click on the .sh file and open it using Mac’s TextEdit application (or any document editing app of your choice).

The .sh file gives Mac the instructions to run the application using the libraries necessary to function and execute correctly.
